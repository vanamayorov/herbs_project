                        Since the legalization of American hemp cultivation with the 2018 Farm Bill, interest in cannabidiol
                        (aka CBD) is off the charts. Although CBD is center stage in the cannabis industry, that doesn’t
                        mean it’s the only cannabinoid worthy of veneration.<br />
                        Indeed, scientists are still discovering dozens
                        of fascinating compounds in cannabis that could be just as useful as CBD.

                        Below, we’ll explore a few of the major <a class="article__underline" href="#">cannabinoids</a>
                        researchers have discovered in hemp thus far.

                        The Superstar: Cann iol (CBD)
                    </h3>

                    <div class="article__text">
                        <p>
                            <b>
                                Let’s start this list with the elephant in the room: cannabidiol. Found abundantly in the hemp
                                plant, CBD has become a superstar in health circles due to its non-psychoactive therapeutic
                                properties. Conservative estimates suggest the CBD market could soar to over $20 billion in just
                                a few years.
                            </b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Many people claim CBD offers numerous therapeutic applications without the risks associated with
                            the psychoactive cannabinoid tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC is the compound that gets users
                            “high” and must be under 0.3 percent in hemp plants grown in the USA.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It should be noted, however, that CBD doesn’t always work its best in isolation. There’s a great
                            deal of research that now suggests different cannabinoids work synergistically to produce a
                            stronger effect. So, while cannabinoids like CBD work well on their own, some scientists believe
                            future strains of hemp should focus on mixing various compounds to create a more potent
                            experience.

                    <h3>CBD’s Originator: Cannabidiolic Acid (CBDA)</h3>

                    <div class="article__text">
                        <p>
                            As a side note, CBD is not naturally produced in the cannabis plant. Instead, all cannabinoids
                            like CBD have to be activated in a process known as decarboxylation, which basically refers to
                            exposing cannabis to extremely high temps or UV lights.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What is present in the natural hemp plant, however, is an interesting compound known as
                            cannabidiolic acid(CBDA). After decarboxylation, it’s this inactive CBDA that becomes the active
                            form of CBD we all know about today.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Interestingly, some scientists believe CBDA could be even more effective than CBD at treating
                            certain issues. The reason for this, they argue, is that CBDA retains greater purity by not
                            having to go through the heating process. Also, CBDA is easier on the lungs, which makes them
                            ideal for people who have compromised respiratory systems.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            CBDA is most often found in a tincture form, but it could also be incorporated into many
                            edibles, soft drink products, and even salad dressings.

                    <h3>The Originator: Cannabigerol (CBG)</h3>

                    <div class="article__text">
                        <p>
                            Although most cannabis plants contain less than one percent of cannabigerol (CBG), this
                            cannabinoid is arguably one of the most important in the cannabis plant. Or, to be more precise,
                            cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) is one of the most significant compounds in cannabis.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The reason CBGA is so important is because it’s the originator of tetrahydrocannabinolic acid
                            (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA). That’s right: without CBGA, there’d be no THC or CBD!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As cannabis plants mature, the original CBGA usually gets broken down by various enzymes and
                            transforms into THCA, CBDA, or a few other acids. This means the more CBD your hemp plant has,
                            the less CBG will be available at the end of the harvesting process.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In order to get more CBG from cannabis, a few cultivators nowadays are deliberately cutting
                            plants in the budding phase. Cutting cannabis plants at this early stage of development usually
                            results in a higher yield of CBGA, which can then be converted to CBG through heat exposure.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So, why would anyone want to extract CBG? Well, for starters, a better understanding of CBGA
                            could help cannabis growers. Since CBGA is the precursor to so many highly sought-after
                            compounds, studying CBGA’s structure could help create plants with higher amounts of specific
                            cannabinoids.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            On top of that, CBG shows great promise as a cure for a few medical conditions. For instance, a
                            few tests show CBG could relieve pressure in the eyes
                        </p>
